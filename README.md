## **Problem Statement**

Mitron Bank, a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad, seeks to launch a new line of credit cards to expand its product offerings and market presence. To evaluate the feasibility and potential success of this initiative, the bank has partnered with AtliQ Data Services for a pilot project.

AtliQ Data Services has been tasked with analyzing a sample dataset of 4,000 customers from five cities, containing details on their online spending and other demographic and behavioral attributes. The goal is to uncover actionable insights and trends that can help Mitron Bank tailor its credit card offerings to meet customer needs and align with market trends.

The analysis should deliver data-driven recommendations that address the following objectives:

 - Identify customer segments with the highest potential for credit card adoption.
 - Understand spending patterns and preferences to design targeted rewards and benefits.
 - Evaluate regional differences and city-specific trends to optimize marketing strategies.
 - Highlight any gaps or opportunities in the current market that the new credit card can address.

The success of this pilot project and the acquisition of the full project depends on AtliQ Data Services' ability to deliver a compelling and insightful analysis that demonstrates a clear value proposition to Mitron Bank's strategy director and his team.
